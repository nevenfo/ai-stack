# KiCAD Design Review & Validation Workflow

This skill guides Claude through systematic design review of a KiCAD project using MCP tools.
ALL checks are performed through MCP tools — never parse .kicad_sch or .kicad_pcb files directly.

---

## Toolset Loading

Load the required toolsets for design review:

```
load_toolset('sch_analysis')     # find_orphan_items, find_shorted_nets, find_single_pin_nets
load_toolset('verification')     # run_drc, check_clearance, get_design_rules
load_toolset('sch_export')       # run_erc
load_toolset('pcb_export')       # get_drc_violations
load_toolset('manufacturing')    # validate_for_manufacturing
load_toolset('design_review')    # audit_decoupling, audit_connections, audit_power_rails, etc.
```

Optional (for deeper analysis):

```
load_toolset('sch_analysis')     # get net info, trace connections, inspect components
load_toolset('pcb_routing')      # query_traces, get_nets_list
```

Always call `get_active_toolsets()` first to see what is already loaded.

---

## Quick Checks (Escalating Severity)

Run these first — they are fast and catch the most critical issues.

### Level 1: Structural Integrity

```
find_orphan_items()
```

Finds floating wires, labels, and symbols not connected to anything.
These are almost always bugs (leftover from edits or incomplete wiring).

### Level 2: Critical Net Issues

```
find_shorted_nets()
```

Detects nets that are connected together but should not be. A shorted net means:
- Two different net labels on the same wire
- Power rails bridged unintentionally
- Signal nets merged by accident

**This is always a critical error. Fix before proceeding.**

### Level 3: Suspicious Connections

```
find_single_pin_nets()
```

A net with only one pin connected is almost always a mistake:
- Incomplete wiring (forgot to connect the other end)
- Orphan net labels (typo in name, so it does not match)
- Leftover stubs from deleted components

## Formal Checks

### ERC — Electrical Rules Check

```
run_erc()
```

Checks schematic-level rules:
- Pin type conflicts (output driving output, unconnected inputs)
- Power pin connections
- Missing no-connect flags
- Duplicate reference designators
- Missing net connections

Review each violation. Some can be waived (e.g., intentional unconnected pins marked with no-connect flag).

### DRC — Design Rules Check

```
get_drc_violations()
```

Checks PCB-level rules:
- Clearance violations (copper-to-copper, copper-to-edge)
- Minimum trace width violations
- Minimum drill size violations
- Unrouted connections (incomplete routing)
- Zone fill issues
- Courtyard overlaps

**Every DRC error must be resolved or explicitly justified before manufacturing.**

---

## Design Audits

These go beyond rule checking — they evaluate design quality and best practices.

### Decoupling Audit

```
audit_decoupling()
```

Checks:
- Every IC power pin has a bypass capacitor
- Capacitor is placed close to the pin (PCB proximity)
- Appropriate capacitor values (100nF ceramic minimum)
- Bulk capacitance present for high-current ICs

### Connection Audit

```
audit_connections()
```

Checks:
- All expected connections are made
- No nets with unexpected fan-out
- Signal integrity basics (termination on long traces)
- Pull-up/pull-down resistors where required (I2C, reset pins, enable pins)

### Power Rail Audit

```
audit_power_rails()
```

Checks:
- All power rails have proper source (regulator, connector, etc.)
- Current capacity matches expected load
- Voltage levels are consistent (no 3.3V device on 5V rail)
- Power sequencing considered for multi-rail designs
- Power flags present (avoids ERC false positives)

### Manufacturing Audit

```
audit_manufacturing()
```

Checks:
- All footprints are fab-house compatible
- Pad sizes meet minimum requirements
- Silkscreen readability
- Test point accessibility
- Fiducial marks present (for SMT assembly)
- Mechanical clearances around mounting holes

## Full Review Shortcut

```
run_design_review()
```

Runs ALL audits and checks in sequence, producing a consolidated report.
Use this for a comprehensive pre-manufacturing review.

Equivalent to running:
1. find_orphan_items
2. find_shorted_nets
3. find_single_pin_nets
4. run_erc
5. get_drc_violations
6. audit_decoupling
7. audit_connections
8. audit_power_rails
9. audit_manufacturing

## Severity Classification

### CRITICAL — Must fix before manufacturing

| Finding                            | Why Critical                                    |
|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Shorted nets                       | Short circuit on the board, may damage components |
| Missing ground connection          | Circuit will not function                       |
| Reversed polarity on power IC      | Immediate destruction on power-up               |
| Unrouted nets                      | Missing connections on fabricated board          |

## Review Workflow

### Quick Review (5-minute check)

1. `find_shorted_nets()` — catch fatal issues
2. `run_erc()` — schematic rule check
3. `get_drc_violations()` — PCB rule check
4. Report findings

### Full Review (comprehensive)

1. Load all review toolsets
2. `run_design_review()` — full audit suite
3. Classify all findings by severity
4. Present report with fix suggestions
5. Offer to fix CRITICAL issues immediately

### Pre-Manufacturing Review

1. Full review (above)
2. `validate_for_manufacturing()` — fab-specific checks
3. Verify BOM completeness
4. Check part availability (if targeting specific fab house)
5. Final verdict: ready to manufacture or not

---

## Rules

1. **Never skip quick checks** — find_shorted_nets catches the worst bugs fast
2. **Classify every finding** — severity helps the user prioritize
3. **Provide specific fixes** — name the MCP tool and parameters to resolve each issue
4. **Run DRC after fixes** — verify that corrections did not introduce new violations
5. **Do not approve a design with CRITICAL issues** — even if the user says "it's fine"
6. **Load toolsets first** — check `get_active_toolsets()` and load what you need
7. **Save before reviewing** — ensures checks run against current state
8. **Offer to fix** — after reporting, offer to use MCP tools to resolve issues
9. **Re-run after fixes** — always verify fixes resolved the issue and created no new ones
10. **Document waivers** — if user explicitly waives a warning, note it in the report
