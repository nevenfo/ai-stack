# KiCAD Schematic Design Workflow

This skill guides Claude to design schematics using Konnect MCP tools.
ALL modifications go through MCP tools — never edit .kicad_sch files directly.

---

## Toolset Loading

Before any schematic work, load the required toolsets:

```
load_toolset('sch_components')   # place, move, rotate, delete symbols
load_toolset('sch_wiring')       # wires, net labels, power symbols, connections
```

Load additional toolsets as needed:

```
load_toolset('library')          # search_symbols, get_symbol_info, list_symbol_libraries
load_toolset('sch_batch')        # batch operations for 3+ items
load_toolset('sch_analysis')     # find components, get pin info, inspect nets
```

Always call `get_active_toolsets()` first to see what is already loaded.

## Component Placement

### Workflow

1. Search the library first: use `search_symbols` to find the correct lib_id
2. Get pin info: use `get_symbol_info` to see pin names, numbers, and positions
3. Place on the 1.27mm grid (KiCAD default schematic grid)
4. Verify placement with `list_schematic_components`

### Common Library IDs

| Component        | lib_id                          |
|------------------|---------------------------------|
| Resistor         | `Device:R`                      |
| Capacitor        | `Device:C`                      |
| Capacitor Polar  | `Device:C_Polarized`            |
| Inductor         | `Device:L`                      |
| LED              | `Device:LED`                    |
| Diode            | `Device:D`                      |
| Zener            | `Device:D_Zener`                |
| NPN Transistor   | `Device:Q_NPN_BCE`              |
| PNP Transistor   | `Device:Q_PNP_BCE`              |
| N-MOSFET         | `Device:Q_NMOS_GDS`             |
| P-MOSFET         | `Device:Q_PMOS_GDS`             |
| 2-pin Connector  | `Connector_Generic:Conn_01x02`  |
| 4-pin Connector  | `Connector_Generic:Conn_01x04`  |
| Ground           | `power:GND`                     |
| +3.3V            | `power:+3V3`                    |
| +5V              | `power:+5V`                     |
| VCC              | `power:VCC`                     |
| VDD              | `power:VDD`                     |

### Rotation Conventions

- 0 degrees: default orientation (pins left/right)
- 90 degrees: rotated CCW (useful for vertical components)
- 180 degrees: flipped horizontally
- 270 degrees: rotated CW

Power symbols: GND uses 0 (arrow points down), VCC/VDD/+3V3/+5V use 0 (arrow points up).

### Spacing Guidelines

- Between ICs: 30-50mm horizontal, 20-30mm vertical
- Between passive components: 10-15mm
- Between a decoupling cap and its IC: 5-10mm
- Leave room for wiring: minimum 5mm between component pins and other elements

## Wiring

### Connection Methods — Decision Table

| Scenario                                | Method                  | Why                                      |
|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Two pins physically close (<30mm)       | `connect_pins`          | Direct wire, auto-routed                 |
| Named signal (SDA, MOSI, EN, etc.)      | `connect_to_net`        | Stub wire + net label, cleaner           |
| Power rail (VCC, GND, +3V3)             | `add_power_symbol`      | Proper power symbol, auto-connects       |
| Bus signals (D0-D7)                     | `connect_to_net`        | Net labels with bus naming               |
| Cross-sheet signal                      | Global label            | Connects across schematic sheets         |
| Multiple pins to same net (3+)          | `batch_connect_to_net`  | Efficient bulk operation                 |

### connect_pins

Use for direct pin-to-pin connections. The tool auto-routes with L-bends.

```
connect_pins(from_component, from_pin, to_component, to_pin)
```

- Specify pins by pin number (from get_schematic_pin_locations)
- Works best when pins are nearby and facing each other
- Automatically creates wire segments with proper bends

### connect_to_net

Use for named nets. Creates a short stub wire and attaches a net label.

```
connect_to_net(component_reference, pin_number, net_name)
```

- Preferred for signals that connect to 3+ pins
- Preferred for named buses and control signals
- Keeps schematic clean and readable
- Net name must be consistent across all connections

### add_power_symbol

Use for all power connections. Never manually wire to power symbols.

```
add_power_symbol(component_reference, pin_number, power_net)
```

- Automatically places the correct power symbol (GND, VCC, etc.)
- Handles orientation automatically
- Connects the pin to the global power net

## Batch Operations

Load `sch_batch` toolset when placing 3 or more components or making bulk connections.

### batch_place_components

Place multiple components in one call. Provide `schematic` and a `components` array of `{lib_id, x, y, rotation?, reference?, value?, unit?}` objects. Pass `reference` explicitly for each component -- it is not auto-assigned.

### batch_connect_to_net

Connect multiple pins to the same net in one call. Ideal for:
- Connecting all VCC pins on an IC
- Connecting all GND pins
- Bus signals across multiple ICs

### batch_edit_schematic_components

Bulk-modify component properties (values, footprints, fields) across multiple components.

### When to Use Batch vs Individual

- 1-2 components: individual calls
- 3+ components: batch operations
- Mixed operations (place + wire): do placement batch first, then wiring batch

## Common Patterns

### Decoupling Capacitor
Place 100nF cap (Device:C) within 5mm of IC power pin. Connect one pin to VCC via power symbol, other pin to GND via power symbol. One cap per VCC/VDD pin.

### Pull-up Resistor
Place resistor (Device:R) vertically. Connect one pin to the signal net via `connect_to_net`, other pin to VCC via `add_power_symbol`. Typical values: 4.7k for I2C, 10k for general.

### Voltage Divider
Two resistors in series, vertically aligned. Top to input net, middle junction to output net, bottom to GND. Use `connect_to_net` for input/output, `add_power_symbol` for GND.

### LED with Current-Limiting Resistor
Resistor in series with LED. Connect resistor to signal/power, resistor to LED anode, LED cathode to GND. R = (Vsupply - Vf) / If. Typical: 330R for 3.3V, 470R for 5V.

### Bypass/Decoupling Filter
For analog circuits: 100nF ceramic + 10uF electrolytic in parallel, close to power pins. Place ceramic closest to IC.

### Crystal Oscillator
Crystal (Device:Crystal) between XI and XO pins. Two load capacitors from each crystal pin to GND. Typical load caps: 12-22pF. Optional 1M feedback resistor across crystal.

## Post-Placement Verification

After placing components and wiring, always run these checks:

### annotate_schematic
Assigns reference designators (R1, C1, U1, etc.) to all unannotated components. Run after all placement is complete.

### validate_wire_connections
Checks that all wires connect properly to pins. Reports:
- Dangling wire ends
- Wires that miss pins
- Overlapping wires

### validate_component_connections
Verifies that components have the expected connections. Reports:
- Unconnected pins that should be connected
- Missing power connections

### find_orphan_items
Finds floating wires, labels, and symbols that are not connected to anything.

### Verification Workflow

1. Place all components
2. Complete all wiring
3. Run `annotate_schematic`
4. Run `validate_wire_connections`
5. Run `validate_component_connections`
6. Run `find_orphan_items`
7. Fix any reported issues
8. Save with `save_project`

## Rules

1. **Never edit .kicad_sch files directly** — all changes go through MCP tools
2. **Never guess pin numbers** — always use `get_schematic_pin_locations` or `get_symbol_info` to look up pin numbers before connecting
3. **Always verify after changes** — run validation tools after placing and wiring
4. **Use the grid** — all placements on 1.27mm grid
5. **Search before placing** — use `search_symbols` to confirm lib_id exists
6. **Power symbols for power** — never manually wire power connections
7. **Net labels for named signals** — keeps schematics readable
8. **Save frequently** — call `save_project` after major operations
9. **Load toolsets first** — check `get_active_toolsets()` and load what you need before starting
10. **Batch for bulk** — use batch toolset for 3+ repetitive operations
